## Lessons Learned:

As an engineer, the pursuit of knowledge is a perpetual journey, irrespective of experience. Motivated by a curiosity to explore advanced DOM manipulations, I opted for a practical approach over a prolonged theoretical study.

Drawing insights from sources like MDN and YouTube, I transformed my learning into a tangible project. Challenges arose, but with dedicated research, I conquered them. This experience highlighted the importance of applying theoretical concepts in a real-world context, dispelling any illusions of superficial knowledge.

This project reinforced the idea that true understanding comes from hands-on application. It demonstrated that tackling challenges in a project setting not only deepens comprehension but also cultivates a problem-solving mindset. The journey affirmed my commitment to continuous learning, emphasizing that theory finds its true meaning when put into practice.
